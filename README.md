## Detail about Project

### Problem Statement

A Parking plaza needs to automate its car parking functionality. The parking plaza has four floors i.e. Basement, Ground Floor, First Floor and Second floor each having a capacity 10 cars. When a car comes in, the controller should tell the user about status of each floor i.e. ‚ÄúSpace Available‚Äù or ‚ÄúFull‚Äù. User can choose a floor to park his car. If a floor is full, the controller will lock the entrance door of the floor and car cannot enter that floor. You have to implement the Car Parking Controller. Also your system should display the cars parked on each floor. You can assume that the cars will come in and get out of the floor in an order.

### Input Signals:
* CarIn
* Floor to park the car
* CarOut

### Output Signals:
* Status of Floors
* Door Locks
* Parked Cars
